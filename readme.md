- The system consists of an IoT-enabled microcontroller connected to sensors and a relay module, which collects compressor data and sends it to a cloud platform. Users can remotely monitor machine health and control the compressor through a dashboard or mobile app.



## 🏗️ Architecture Flow

- Sensors measure pressure, temperature, current, and vibration.

- Microcontroller (ESP32/NodeMCU) reads sensor data and processes it.

- Communication Protocol (MQTT/HTTP) sends data to the cloud.

- Cloud Platform stores data, generates alerts, and updates dashboards.

- User Interface (Mobile/Web App) displays real-time status and graphs.

- Control Commands from the app are sent back to the microcontroller.

- Relay Module switches the compressor ON/OFF based on commands or safety logic.
